## 🎯 Core Features Breakdown

### **🗳️ Smart Voting System**
Our voting system uses a boolean-based approach where users can upvote (`is_upvote: true`) or downvote (`is_upvote: false`) content. The polymorphic design allows voting on both questions and answers through a single votes table, with `is_answer` flag determining the target type.

### **📝 Content Management**
- **UUID-based IDs**: All entities use UUID primary keys for distributed scalability
- **Rich Content**: Questions and answers support markdown formatting and image uploads
- **Tag System**: Simple comma-separated tags for flexible categorization
- **Content Ownership**: Clear author attribution with edit/delete permissions

### **🔍 Advanced Search & Discovery**
- **Multi-field Search**: Search across question titles, descriptions, and tags
- **Smart Sorting**: Three sorting modes - trending (24h activity), latest, and most popular
- **Tag Filtering**: Filter content by specific tags with pagination support
- **Homepage Algorithm**: Trending content prioritizes recent questions with high engagement

### **🔔 Notification Engine**
Our notification system uses integer types (1, 2, 3) to categorize different notification types:
- **Type-based Filtering**: Filter notifications by specific interaction types
- **Read Status Tracking**: Boolean flag for efficient unread notification queries
- **Bulk Operations**: Mark all notifications as read in single API call
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Real-time counts of total, read, and unread notifications

### **👤 User Experience Features**
- **Profile Analytics**: Detailed user profiles showing questions, answers, comments, and upvotes
- **Public Profiles**: View other users' public contributions and activity
- **Admin Controls**: Boolean `type` field determines admin privileges
